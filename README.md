Benchmarking tool for Datalog Engines


Welcome to the GitHub repository for our Master's Team project, a Datalog benchmarking tool developing under the guidance of our esteemed professors. Our goal is to create a powerful and user-friendly tool that enables users to measure the performance of datalog engines.  The purpose of this repository is to provide a central location for collaboration and version control. Here, you will find the source code, documentation, and other resources related to the development of our benchmarking tool.  We encourage all team members to contribute to the repository by adding new features, fixing bugs, and improving the codebase. To ensure that our code is of high quality, we have established a set of coding standards and guidelines that we expect all contributors to follow.  We will also use this repository to track issues and bugs, as well as to plan and organize our project. We will use GitHub's built-in tools, such as the issue tracker and project boards, to manage our work and stay on schedule.  We are excited to be working on this project and look forward to creating a valuable tool that will benefit the datalog community. Thank you for your contributions and support!
