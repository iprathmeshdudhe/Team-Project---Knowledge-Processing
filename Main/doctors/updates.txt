1. Rulewerk .rls file translation to clingo rule files
2. Taking input as csv from datasources
3. Running the clingo rule from cmd prompt within the python code
4. Measuring the CPU & Memory usage


Questions:

1. In general one benchmark-case will consist of one (or more) rule-file(s) with various rules and directives (e.g. loading facts/data from other sources like csv-files).

Can you clarify it?

2.  Is this the correct way to write Existential variable in clingo?

1 { prescription(v_id, v_patient, v_npi, C1) } 1 :- treatment(v_id, v_patient, v_hospital, v_npi, v_conf1), physician(v_npi, v_name, v_spec, v_conf2), C1 = 1..n.
